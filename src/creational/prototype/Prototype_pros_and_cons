Example in java:
In Java the root Object class exposes a clone method. The class implements the interface java.lang.Cloneable.


Pros:

Dynamic Loading:
The prototype pattern also helps with dynamic loading of classes.
Language frameworks which allow dynamic loading will create an instance of the loaded class and register it in a managing entity.
The application can at runtime request the object of the loaded class from the manager. Note, the application can't access the class's constructor statically.


Cons:

Implementing the clone method can be challenging because of circular references.
